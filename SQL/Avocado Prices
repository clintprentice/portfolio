Verify the total number of bags.
Done by selecting the date, region, and collection of tables for Bag Sizes (S,L,XL) and Total Bags.
Then do a calculation to verify if Total Bags is a sum of all bag sizes.

Calculate the percentage of small bags. This will help stakeholders make decisions about
how to package avocados or which size bag to run a sale on.
Note: Total Bags column has values of 0 which return a "division by zero" error. This is 
overcome by adding the WHERE clause to specify bags that do not equal 0.
