## Warby Parker Data Analysis Project

#### Data gathered by codecademy

In this project, I was given a large dataset of 1000 responses to Warby Parker's Home Try-On Style Quiz.

I wanted to find out the number of responses for each question, ask why users may have dropped off from the quiz and not gone onto the next step.

From there I wanted actionable insights into the data presented. 

- What are the most popular choices for glasses?
- The least popular choices?
- What can this tell us about the Home Try-On program?
- Additionally, once they have the Home Try-On Kit, how likely are they to purchase glasses?
