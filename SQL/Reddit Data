# Multiple Tables with Reddit from Codecademy
# For this project, you’ll be working as a Data Analyst who will be examining some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site.

#On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate others’ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.

#The users table has:
#  - id
#  - username
#  - email
#  - join_date
#  - score

#The posts table has:
#  - id
#  - title
#  - user_id
#  - subreddit_id
#  - score
#  - created_date

#The subreddits table has:
#  - id
#  - name
#  - created_date
#  - subscriber_count

# What user has the highest score?
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS 'subreddit_count'
FROM subreddits;

# What post has the highest score?
SELECT 
  username,
  MAX(score) AS 'highest_score'
FROM users;

# What are the top 5 subreddits with the highest subscriber count?
SELECT
  title,
  MAX(score) AS 'highest_score'
FROM posts;

SELECT name
FROM subreddits
ORDER BY subscriber_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

# Find out how many posts each user has made
SELECT users.username, 
  COUNT(posts.id) AS 'posts_made'
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts
  ON users.id = posts.user_id
GROUP BY users.id
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

# Only show existing posts where users are still active
SELECT *
FROM posts
INNER JOIN users
  ON posts.user_id = users.id;

# Find out which subreddits have the most popular posts
# Assume popularity is a score of 5000 or more
WITH popular_posts AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM posts
  WHERE score >= 5000
)
SELECT subreddits.name,
  popular_posts.title,
  popular_posts.score
FROM subreddits
INNER JOIN popular_posts
  ON subreddits.id = popular_posts.subreddit_id
ORDER BY popular_posts.score DESC;

# Highest scoring post for each subreddit
SELECT 
  posts.id,
  posts.title,
  subreddits.name AS 'subreddit_name',
  MAX(posts.score) AS 'highest_score'
FROM posts
INNER JOIN subreddits
  ON posts.subreddit_id = subreddits.id
GROUP BY subreddits.id;

# Average score of all posts for each subreddit
SELECT 
  subreddits.name, 
  ROUND(AVG(posts.score),2) AS 'average_score'
FROM subreddits
INNER JOIN posts
ON subreddits.id = posts.subreddit_id
GROUP BY subreddits.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
