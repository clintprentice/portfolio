# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Congratulations on making it this far! 
My name is Clint Prentice and I am building a data analytics portfolio for a full-on career change. Answering questions with data has been something that has facsinated me long before I discovered the data analytics career. I love mysteries and putting together pieces of a puzzle. It might not make sense at first but, given time and a little inginuity, you can uncover some awesome insights.

I have 9 years of Operations Management experience that has dealt with many data-based problems. Using Excel or Google Sheets VLOOKUPs and Pivot Tables allowed me to prove hypothesis through data (and get me out of a number of jams too). When I decided to make the career switch, I knew nothing about SQL, Python, or R. Most things I knew came from Excel -- often, jobs would call me the Spreadsheet Wiz (don't tell them most things I didn't know I just did some googling). But I found a passion for sifting through the data and finding cool stuff. So then I picked up some SQL and now a new career is something I'm pursuing with incredible earnest.

This is broken down by projects in different languages.
### Languages included:
  * SQL
  * R (coming soon)
  * Python (eventually)
